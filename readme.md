This project has been made only for the practice purpose.

Use nodemon / nodejs to start the server.

There are three methods only

```
#Routes

GET `/todos` - To get the all todos

POST `/todos?title=Learn nodejs&completed=false` - To create a new todo item.

DELETE `/todos?id=6` - To delete the todo item.
```

The data is being stored in the `data.json` file
